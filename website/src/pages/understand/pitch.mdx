# Understanding Pitch

Let's learn how pitch works! But first, let's experience pitch in its rawest form:

<PitchSlider client:load />

- Drag the slider to hear a pitch
- Move the slider to change the pitch
- Observe how the number on the right changes

The number on the right is the **frequency** of the pitch you're hearing.
The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch and vice versa.
A pitch occurs whenever something is vibrating / oscillating at a frequency, in this case it's your speaker.
The unit **Hz** describes how many times that oscillation happens per second.
Our eyes are too slow to actually see the oscillation on the speaker, but we can [see it in slow motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDMBWw7OuJQ&t=5s).

## Pitch Perception

Maybe you have already noticed that the pitch slider is "lopsided". To make that more obvious, let's automate the slider!
Below are 2 buttons for automation, try them out:

<PitchSlider animatable plot client:load />

There are 2 different colored lines:

- <span style="color:#3b82f6;">blue</span>: the frequency value
- <span style="color:#eab308">yellow</span>: the pitch value or how you perceive the frequency

Depending on the type of sweep, the lines behave differently:

- Frequency Sweep: <span style="color:#3b82f6;">frequency is linear</span> , <span style="color:#eab308">pitch is logarithmic</span>
- Pitch Sweep: <span style="color:#3b82f6;">frequency is exponential</span> , <span style="color:#eab308">pitch is linear</span>

Don't be scared of these mathematical terms:

- "logarithmic" is just a fancy way of saying "it starts fast and slows down"
- "exponential" is just a fancy way of saying "it starts slow and gets faster"

## A Pitch Slider

Most of the time, we might want to control pitch in a way that matches our perception.
Now that we know that frequency in Hz does not match our perception,
let's make the slider exponential (and yellow):

<PitchSlider logarithmic plot animatable client:load />

- Do you see how the slider is now linked to the yellow line?
- Try out the buttons again and compare it to the frequency slider above

## A unit for Pitch

Let's try to find a linear unit for pitch, as frequency won't cut it.
To approach that unit of pitch, let's look at how frequency behaves when it is doubled:

<PitchSlider logarithmic client:load buttons={[50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600]} />

- Can you hear how these pitches seem related to each other?

<PitchSlider logarithmic client:load buttons={[50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600]} />


## Definition

From [wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)>): "Pitch is a perceptual property of sounds that allows their ordering on a frequency-related scale,[1] or more commonly, pitch is the quality that makes it possible to judge sounds as "higher" and "lower" in the sense associated with musical melodies."

The oscillation is just a pattern of movement that repeats over and over again.
