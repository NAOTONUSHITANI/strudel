# Understanding Pitch

Let's learn how pitch works! The slider below controls the <span style="color:#3b82f6;">frequency</span> of an oscillator, producing a pitch:

{/* <PitchSlider client:load showFrequencySlider plot /> */}

<PitchSlider client:load showFrequencySlider />

- Drag the slider to hear a pitch
- Move the slider to change the pitch
- Observe how the Hz number changes

The Hz number is the frequency of the pitch you're hearing.
The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch and vice versa.
A pitch occurs whenever something is vibrating / oscillating at a frequency, in this case it's your speaker.
The unit **Hz** describes how many times that oscillation happens per second.
Our eyes are too slow to actually see the oscillation on the speaker, but we can [see it in slow motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDMBWw7OuJQ&t=5s).

## Frequency vs Pitch Perception

Maybe you have already noticed that the <span style="color:#3b82f6;">frequency slider</span> is "lopsided",
meaning the pitch changes more in the left region and less in the right region.
To make that more obvious, let's add a <span style="color:#eab308">pitch slider</span>
that controls the frequency on a different scale:

<PitchSlider animatable plot showFrequencySlider showPitchSlider client:load />

Try out the buttons above to sweep through the frequency range in 2 different ways:

- Frequency Sweep: <span style="color:#3b82f6;">frequency rises linear</span> , <span style="color:#eab308">pitch rises logarithmic</span>
- Pitch Sweep: <span style="color:#3b82f6;">frequency rises exponential</span> , <span style="color:#eab308">pitch rises linear</span>

Don't be scared of these mathematical terms:

- "logarithmic" is just a fancy way of saying "it starts fast and slows down"
- "exponential" is just a fancy way of saying "it starts slow and gets faster"

Most of the time, we might want to control pitch in a way that matches our perception,
which is what the <span style="color:#eab308">pitch slider</span> does.

## From Hz to Semitones

Because Hz does not match our perception, let's try to find a unit for pitch that matches.
To approach that unit of pitch, let's look at how frequency behaves when it is doubled:

<PitchSlider client:load showPitchSlider showFrequencySlider pitchStep={1 / 7} />

- Use the now stepped pitch slider above
- Can you hear how these pitches seem related to each other?

In mathematical terms, the frequency of button `n` would be `50Hz * 2^n` (n starting from 0).
We could already use that `n` as a pitch unit! So a value of 0 would relate to a certain base frequency (50Hz),
and each whole number step would be an additional doubling of 2.

In musical terms, a pitch with double the frequency of another is an `octave` higher.

Because octaves are pretty far apart, octaves are typically divided into 12 equal parts:

<PitchSlider client:load showPitchSlider showFrequencySlider pitchStep={1 / 12} min={440} max={880} initial={440} />

## Definition

From [wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)>): "Pitch is a perceptual property of sounds that allows their ordering on a frequency-related scale,[1] or more commonly, pitch is the quality that makes it possible to judge sounds as "higher" and "lower" in the sense associated with musical melodies."

The oscillation is just a pattern of movement that repeats over and over again.
