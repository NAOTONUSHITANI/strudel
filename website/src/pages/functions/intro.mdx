# Functional JavaScript API

While the mini notation is powerful on its own, there is much more to discover.
Internally, the mini notation will expand to use the actual functional JavaScript API.

For example, this Pattern in Mini Notation:

<MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`note("c3 eb3 g3")`} />

is equivalent to this Pattern without Mini Notation:

<MiniRepl client:only="react" tune={`note(seq(c3, eb3, g3))`} />

Similarly, there is an equivalent function for every aspect of the mini notation.

Which representation to use is a matter of context. As a rule of thumb, you can think of the JavaScript API
to fit better for the larger context, while mini notation is more practical for individiual rhythms.

## Limits of Mini Notation

While the Mini Notation is a powerful way to write rhythms shortly, it also has its limits. Take this example:

<MiniRepl
  client:idle
  tune={`stack(
  note("c2 eb2(3,8)").s('sawtooth').cutoff(800),
  s("bd,~ sd,hh*4")
)`}
/>

Here, we are using mini notation for the individual rhythms, while using the function `stack` to mix them.
While stack is also available as `,` in mini notation, we cannot use it here, because we have different types of sounds.
