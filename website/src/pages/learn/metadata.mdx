# Music metadata

You can optionally add some music metadata in your Strudel code, by using tags in code comments like this:

```
// @license: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/
// @author: Felix Roos
// @details: Inspired by Friendship - Let's not talk about it (1979) :)
```

Like other comments, those are ignored by Strudel, but it can be used by other tools to retrieve some information about the music.

It is for instance used by the [swatch tool](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/tree/main/my-patterns) to display pattern titles in the [examples page](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/examples/).

Available tags are:

- `@title`: music title
- `@by`: music author(s), separated with comma, eventually followed with a link in `<>` (ex: `@author john doe <https://example.com>`)
- `@license`: music license
- `@details`: some additional information about the music
- `@url`: web page related to the music (git repo, soundcloud link, etc.)
- `@genre`: music genre (pop, jazz, etc)
- `@album`: music album name
